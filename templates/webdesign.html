                        <p>A well-designed website is a key to user experience, and, unless you have coding and design
                            knowledge yourself, finding a web designer is the easiest way to have a well-designed site.
                            Whether you plan to hire an in-house website designer/developer or outsource your design and
                            development to an agency, it is important to know a few basics, i.e. what to expect from a
                            professional.</p>
                        <p>This article will outline reasons why you should hire a website designer and how it could
                            make an impact on your business.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>A Great Website Design</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>A professional website designer will know all the details a site should contain, that not
                            only catch the user’s eye at the very beginning but engages them to keep them on the page.
                            Some of the requirements they may recommend are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Updating the site to look more current</li>
                            <li>Laying it out so that it is easy to navigate</li>
                            <li>Optimizing it so that it reaches the people who need the service or product</li>
                            <li>A well-placed call to action points</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>These are website design factors that will raise its ranking by making it more prominent,
                            frequently visited and a better place to keep potential customers on the page for longer.
                        </p>
                        <p>People are spending more time online than ever, that’s why having a business website is now
                            necessary. Having a web designer to suit your branding preferences is essential. It will
                            produce more engagements and conversions to your site.

                        <!-- <a href="#" class="btn btn-primary">Go somewhere</a> -->
                        <ol start="2">
                            <li>Ensures High-functionality</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p style="padding-bottom:6px;">It is essential to understand how much the design of your site
                            impacts its search engine rankings. Website design is not only about the layout, although
                            this is also a vital part. The functionality of the site is determined by its loading time
                            and not just the layout. In these busy times and with so many options out there, a customer
                            will not stay on a page that takes too long to load.</p>
                        <!-- <p style="padding-bottom:6px;"></p> -->
                        <p style="padding-bottom:6px;">Some questions your website design professional will ask you are:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>How is your site persuading the visitor into an action such as visiting your business,
                                contacting you for a query, or buying one of your products?</li>
                            <li>What target market are you aiming to capture?</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p style="padding-bottom:6px;">They will also look at such things as how well your site is
                            organized and whether it gives the user a sense of trust when they arrive on the landing
                            page. Visitors must always be able to find what they are looking for in a pleasing way. This
                            is achieved by a design that is consistent and makes sense to whoever is using it.</p>

                        <ol start="3">
                            <li>Boosting Professionals in your Locality</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p style="padding-bottom:6px;">Whether you want a brand-new website for a new venture or a
                            redesigned website to give it a more modern touch, your business should reach the people in
                            your area first, so that they are aware of your services and products as their first choice.
                            The words “near me” are one of the most frequently used pairings in search engines.</p>
                        <p style="padding-bottom:6px;">Hiring locals can always be advantageous and when you choose a
                            web design service that operates in your locality, you are assured they will know all the
                            mediums of communication that are available to get your website into the community. If you
                            want a starter website on a budget or a complex online shopping site where you sell your
                            products, asking an expert in web design to create it for you is the first step to more
                            success.</p>
