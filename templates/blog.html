                            <p style="font-size: 100%">Before you start your journey with NodeJS you should have a clear
                                goal in your mind that why do you want to learn NodeJS? What exactly do you want to do
                                with NodeJS? Do you want to build some web applications, to start your own business or
                                your purpose is to get a new job? Do you want to build some chat applications or do you
                                want to build some online games?<br>Most beginners make a common mistake that they start
                                learning a language/framework just for the sake of learning it without having a goal in
                                mind. Keep in mind that learning a new technology or language is a different thing and
                                using it to build some real-world application is different and as a programmer, your
                                purpose should be to be able to build stuff and not just to learn. So firstly explore
                                each field and find out where your interest lies.<br>We have discussed various fields
                                where NodeJS can be used. So first, decide what exactly you want to build, once your
                                goal is decided, stick with it and move to the next step i.e. to find out resources.</p>
                            <h3 style="text-align:center">How to Learn NodeJS?</h3>
                            <p style="font-size: 100%">To learn NodeJS the most important thing you should know is <a
                                    href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/javascript-tutorial/">JavaScript. </a>Don’t make
                                the mistake to learn Node until or unless you do not have a good command of JavaScript.
                                Whatever you will be building with NodeJS, you will be using a lot of JavaScript
                                concepts. If you’re interested in knowing the path of learning JavaScript then check the
                                link <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-become-a-javascript-developer/">How
                                    to Become a JavaScript Developer?</a> Once you have a good command of JavaScript
                                move to NodeJS and find the resources for it…</p>
                            <h4>Learning Resources</h4>
                            <p style="font-size: 100%;">There are plenty of resources and videos available online and
                                it’s confusing for developers where to start learning all the concepts. Initially, as a
                                beginner, if you get overwhelmed with so many concepts then don’t be afraid and stop
                                learning. Have patience, explore, and stay committed to it. Also, whatever resource you
                                prefer code along with that resource. Keep in mind that none of the tutorials or courses
                                can teach you any language or framework if you don’t get your hands dirty in the code.
                                So code while you learn and build some applications on your own.</p>

                            <p>Check out the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"
                                    href="https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/">official documentation</a> and learn the
                                various concepts of NodeJS in detail. You can also visit the link <a

                                    GeeksforGeeks</a>. You can also go for some online video tutorials or courses but in
                                most of the courses, different instructors may cover different concepts of NodeJS. This
                                can be overwhelming for you and it can create confusion as well. So it’s important to
                                know the clear path or roadmap to learn NodeJS.&nbsp;</p>

                            <h3 style="text-align:center">A Roadmap to Learn</h3>
                            <h4>1. Introduction to NodeJS</h4>
                            <p>Start with the basic <a
                                    href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-nodejs/">introduction</a> part
                                of NodeJS. You should know what is NodeJS, where it is used, some of its features, and
                                why companies are using it. You can read the article <a
                                    href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/7-famous-apps-built-on-nodejs-reasons-and-benefits/">7
                                    Famous Apps Built on NodeJS: Reasons and Benefits</a> to know why companies switched
                                to NodeJS to build their application. It’s important to know why to choose NodeJS over
                                another framework for the development of server-side applications. Explore the different
                                application areas of NodeJS, advantages, limitations, and NodeJS application deployment
                                server.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>We are giving an overview but explore this topic in more detail…</p>
                            <p>NodeJS is a Server-side JavaScript runtime environment built on Google’s Chrome V8
                                JavaScript engine. It compiles the JavaScript code into the native machine code and
                                provides higher efficiency of the application. It’s a cross-platform runtime environment
                                that provides an event-driven, non-blocking input-output system. This feature makes it
                                the best suitable for building fast, highly reliable, and scalable network or web
                                application as well as a data-intensive real-time application.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>NodeJS provides good throughput and higher consistency and that’s why it is heavily used
                                by companies for building large scalable single-page applications, video streaming
                                applications, and web applications.&nbsp;</p>
                            <h4>&nbsp;<strong>History and Release</strong></h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Released in 2009 and the first version of NPM is created. It was introduced by
                                    <strong>Ryan Dahl.&nbsp;</strong>
                                </li>
                                <li>In 2010 Express and socket.io are introduced.</li>
                                <li>In 2011 LinkedIn, Uber, and many big companies start using NodeJS.</li>
                                <li>In 2016 Yarn was introduced along with Node.js 6</li>
                                <li>The latest LTS Version of NodeJS is 12.18.3.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h4>2. Learn about the NodeJS Architecture</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Based on the single-threaded event loop model architecture which means client
                                    requests will be executed by a single thread in NodeJS.</li>
                                <li>The event-driven nature of NodeJS allows you to handle multiple client requests
                                    concurrently.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4><strong>3. Installation of NodeJS</strong></h4>
                            <p>Installing NodeJS is a very simple procedure. You can download the stable version of
                                NodeJs from the<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"
                                    href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/"> NodeJS official site. </a>Depending on your
                                operating system and system configurations install NodeJS and then you can immediately
                                start working on it. Make sure that your RAM is at least 4GB to support NodeJS.</p>

                            <h4>4. <strong>NPM (Node Package Manager)</strong></h4>
                            <p>The Node package manager is one of the most important core concepts to learn in NodeJS.
                                After the installation, part learns about NPM. NPM comes with <i>800, 000+ </i>libraries
                                that can be used for different purposes. These prebuilt libraries come with their own
                                code to build different features in NodeJS. So you don’t need to build everything from
                                scratch. You can simply install the required library using the npm command and use that
                                in your application. So these libraries help a lot in speeding up the application
                                development process.&nbsp;</p>

                            <h4>5. <strong>JSON File</strong></h4>
                            <p>JSON file is another essential and most important concept to learn in NodeJS. The first
                                thing you do in any NodeJS project is creating JSON file. It is the manifest file in any
                                project and you can find this file with the name package.json in your application. It
                                contains the metadata of the project. In other words, it manages and holds the
                                information about packages and dependencies along with the script used in the project.
                                If you ever want to check which packages or dependencies are used in the application,
                                you can simply open this file and check the information.&nbsp;</p>
